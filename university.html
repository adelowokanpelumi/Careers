         <p class="engfont">We're listeners and advocates, mentors and hosts. We view students as individuals, the recruiting process as a shared adventure, and decisions as conversations. Our mission is to open Tuteria's doors to the next class of interns and new grads who are ready for a life-changing experience and excited to create a world of belonging.

         <h3>New Graduate</h3>
         <p class="engfont">Every engineer deploys on their first day — and every day after that too. We use Amazon Web Services and practice continuous deployment so we can quickly try out new ideas and iterate on existing product features, and we love experimenting with new technology if it's right for the job. Not only do we ride the cutting edge, we make it: we've open sourced Hypernova, a service for server-side rendering your JavaScript views, and Chronos, a distributed fault-tolerant scheduler that runs on top of Apache Mesos, among other projects. Our engineers regularly present at conferences around the country.

         <h3>Engineering Intern Progam</h3>
         <p class="engfont">We believe that engineering is a continuous process of learning and improvement, and that the best way to learn is by getting help from your fellow engineers. All of our engineers hang out in chat rooms so that we can keep informal knowledge sharing flowing — and because coding is more fun when you do it together. We host regular tech talks, both internal and external, so that everyone gets a chance to become the best at their craft.
