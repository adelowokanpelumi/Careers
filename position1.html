         <p class="design">No global movement springs from individuals. It takes an entire team united behind something big. Together, we work hard, we laugh a lot, we brainstorm nonstop, we use hundreds of Post-Its and we give the best high-fives in town.
         </p>

         <p class="design">The Experience Design team at Tuteria is a small group of multi-disciplinary designers that brings our product to life (offline and online).

            DPMs at Tuteria are creative problem solvers and great communicators that understand the needs of a fast paced product design org. As a DPM your primary objective is to make the design organization as effective as possible. You’ll be responsible for developing and applying just the right amount of process for your teams. With a strong appreciation for the practice and process of design, you understand the multiple disciplines that go into a successful product. You bring creativity to the operational aspects of a design team and deal with solving the “how”, freeing up your design lead peers to focus on crafting the “what”. You will define how design interacts with cross-functional teams and be an advocate at all times.
