      <div class="containerr">
         <p class="engfont">Tuteria is the world's largest marketplace for space, and we keep getting bigger every day. With 10 million nights booked and counting, we're constantly taking on challenges in search algorithms, payments, fraud prevention, and growth — all while maintaining a beautiful user experience. We want to build solutions to these problems that are scalable, performant, and elegant, and we're looking for talented people to help us do just that.

         <h3>Move Fast</h3>
         <p class="engfont">Every engineer deploys on their first day — and every day after that too. We use Amazon Web Services and practice continuous deployment so we can quickly try out new ideas and iterate on existing product features, and we love experimenting with new technology if it's right for the job. Not only do we ride the cutting edge, we make it: we've open sourced Hypernova, a service for server-side rendering your JavaScript views, and Chronos, a distributed fault-tolerant scheduler that runs on top of Apache Mesos, among other projects. Our engineers regularly present at conferences around the country.

         <h3>Learn Together</h3>
         <p class="engfont">We believe that engineering is a continuous process of learning and improvement, and that the best way to learn is by getting help from your fellow engineers. All of our engineers hang out in chat rooms so that we can keep informal knowledge sharing flowing — and because coding is more fun when you do it together. We host regular tech talks, both internal and external, so that everyone gets a chance to become the best at their craft.

         <p class="engfont">That's our word for the dedication and craftsmanship we bring to our work. For us, engineering isn't just a job but a practice that we want to perfect. We aim to keep our systems modular, our code clean, and our documentation clear, and we follow the idea of leaving things better than how you found it. It's not just about the code — putting the right processes and tools in place to make developers happy and efficient is important to us because it gives us the time to focus on polishing the product.
